Sunny King and Scott Nadal invented Peercoin in August 2012 as the first Proof of Stake secured cryptocurrency. #Genesis
Peercoin’s blockchain security rests entirely on PoS.  PoW mining is used only to generate a fair initial coin distribution. #fair #security
ICOs create central points of failure for Proof of Stake systems. Peercoin has been fairly distributing coins since 2012. #fair #OG
Peercoin was first to implement a dust limit, fee burning, fixed fees, a coherent inflation rate, oh yah and Proof of Stake. #OG #pioneer
While Peercoin’s inflation due to PoS is only ~1%, a continuous minter currently gets around 5%/year rewards. #sustainability
The mint reward rate is related to a) how many coins are participating, and b) the mint difficulty. Time is the difference. #participation
Time is the expended commodity in PoS networks. Afterall, isn’t time the only thing we truly have to offer? #deepthoughts
Peercoin strives to survive as an immutable record. The moon is just a side trip. #immutability
Opportunity cost is real. Peercoin atrophies its attackers with its mere existence. #survive
PoS inflation can be seen as a nominal ‘in name only’ interest because anyone can participate. #accessible
The Peercoin DAO is more than the blockchain, it is all of us at the moment of our most caring. #voluntary
The PoS reward is in two parts, a 3%/year coinage part, and ~1.25 PPC/block static part. #minting
Peercoin inflation is around half PoS and half PoW. Distribution is #hybrid, while security is 100% #PoS. 
PoW block rewards go down when PoW difficulty goes up in Peercoin. 16x difficulty cuts the reward in half. #sustainable
Self-governance is a core attribute of PoS. Combined with fair distribution, Peercoin sets the bar for #justice in economics.
Deflationary cryptocurrencies are doomed to fail once their block rewards run out. #Sustainability is multi-faceted.
While the Foundation allows for #accountability and a way to centralize efforts, Peercoin thrives off volunteers.
PeerAssets is a #tokenization protocol designed to be lightweight to fit on an #efficient chain like Peercoin.
With a ~1GB blockchain, Peercoin’s #efficiency allows for a true peer-to-peer protocol. Full nodes for all.
Peercoin has a fee of 0.01 PPC/KB, no calculators required. #simple
Backbone settlement layers with long-term distributed #consensus are proven over #time.
Time: it’s not just for clocks anymore. #Peercoin
Ever hear the phrase ‘time is money’? Ok, now multiply them together. #coinage
Distributed consensus allows for collections of individuals to find common ground, and to walk away. #voluntary
#Protocol changes occur when innovation is implemented. #Design starts with discussion of ideas and moves to an RFC.
Talk is cheap, so come do a lot of it with us. #Adaptability to new ideas is key.
It’s not easy being #green.
Great care has been put into keeping #decentralized projects decentralized. New coins on the block don’t get that.
Fees are #burned in Peercoin rather than recycled, keeping the blockchain tight and #efficient.
You will be #outlasted by the sunrise and by Peercoin.
Only three things in life are certain: death, taxes, and the next Peercoin block. #reliability
Outputs start to have a chance to #mint at 30 days old and reach maximum mint #probability at 90 days.
Each output to a transaction is a lottery ticket to #mint. The #timestamp of the formed block chooses the winners.
The standard client will #split outputs in two that mint earlier than 90 days.
What is the ideal output size to maximize mint rewards? It depends on the PoS #difficulty, but around 20-200 #PPC is fine.
Many Peercoin point upgrades are #hardforks, allowing the protocol to truly improve and flaunting the strength of our #consensus.
Democratically self-governed, Peercoin does not fear those who have not put in the time. #trust
Peercoin is the Eye of Agamotto. #DrStrange
#Development on Peercoin has been two-fold: maintaining #compatibility with Bitcoin code, and building our own #unique mechanisms.
Our full nodes are #streamlined enough to fit on a Raspberry Pi, a small computer, or an Internet of Things device.

The ‘Export’ button in the ‘Transactions’ tab outputs a .csv of your activities. Peercoin #Analytics aims help interpret it.
The testnet is a #mirror network with faster protocol parameters that we release updates on first to #troubleshoot them.
While #testnet coins are not worth money, being a reliable minter on the testnet helps the whole #ecosystem. 
When minting, you #hash the block and its timestamp (1 hash/utxo/second), and compare to the difficulty per unit #coinage.
Difficulty throttled PoW rewards prevent the snowballing of #energy consumption due to mining.
Outputs have a minimum size called the ‘dust limit’ which prevents #spam. It is a widely used Peercoin invention.
Rather than relying on a #feemarket and a blocksize limit, Peercoin uses a fixed fee rate to give #value to data.
You can provably #burn Peercoin simply by including a higher fee than is required. Fees are burnt.
Distributed consensus is all about strangers on the internet #agreeing. It’s nothing short of a #miracle.
OP_RETURN is a specially marked output that allows for #arbitrary data inclusion in a block, up to a limit, paying required fees.
The economics of Peercoin are uniquely defined around the act of #participation in the consensus process.
Around 7000 out of 12000 coins are PoS, intellectual #progeny of Peercoin. Even high cap coins like ETH wanna be us.
If Peercoin consumed as much #energy as Bitcoin, the price would have to be $400k/ppc with a #marketcap of $11 trillion.
The PoW component of Peercoin is made to taper off as the #efficiency of computer hardware gets better.
Every transaction ever performed is stored redundantly as an #immutable record on every full node. #transparency
Cryptocurrency is pseudo-anonymous. Many find that scary, but the battle of virtual #psuedoanonymity is #nuanced.
The agility of our love can help overcome obstacles that would otherwise be insurmountable. #hope  Wait, what am I supposed to be talking about again?
Peercoin is basically #Chronos, #Aion, and Father #Time wrapped up in one.
Get me some of that green green. #efficient #money
Crypto is always greener on the other side of the proof. #proofofstake
I feel like I should be distributing leaflets. #prosthelytizing #leaf
Put that in your pipe and smoke it. #GreenCrypto
In many coins, staking is privilege of those who hold the premine. But not with Peercoin! #proofofstake #staking
A #block contains transactions including a coinbase and a #coinstake. Peercoin added the coinstake as a special transaction that overrides the proof of work coinbase and is validated by proof of stake.
Peercoin Charts (peercoinexplorer.net/charts) is a very good resource for checking out the history of performance for key network metrics such as inflation or difficulty.
Peercoin has an #algorithmic inflation defined with a ~2% annualized target in mind. Fluctuations are determined by network participation, rather than any centralized entity.
The community surrounding Peercoin has evolved over time, but has always remained connected with its founding people and principles.
Peercoin is the energy #efficient alternative to Bitcoin, and always has been.
Peercoin token allocation: Team: 0% Foundation: 0% Investors: 0% Advisors: 0% Ecosystem: 0% Marketing: 0%
For better or for worse, Peercoin's PoS difficulty is a more sophisticated #organism than the gut reactions of the hash market.
Peercoin is the only blockchain project except Bitcoin which is developed and maintained by a second generation team. Original team which has started the project is long gone and new core group of people has organically grew out of the community.
There is no minimum amount of coins required to mint, one can mint with 1000 PPC or with 15 PPC or 3.5 PPC. You can also mint with 0.85 PPC. However, It can take several years of continuous node operation to find a block with under 1 ppc.
Stake: Coin that is leveraged to find blocks in a proof of stake network. Peercoin uses coin-age, or coins held over time, that is consumed in order to securely build the blockchain chronology. Coins are not consumed in this process, only their #coinage.
Block Reward: When a new block is found it includes a special #coinbase transaction that creates new coin. In Peercoin, block rewards can come from either proof of work or proof of stake blocks.
Minting: The act of making a block via proof of stake. While in Peercoin minting and staking are synonymous, in some networks minting is delegated to a representative, and most of the coinholders themselves are merely staking, not minting.
Mining: The act of making a block via proof of work. Peercoin uses a sha-256 hashing algorithm, which is the same one used by Bitcoin. This means that the same ASIC hardware used on Bitcoin can be used on Peercoin.
Difficulty: The threshold for a valid block hash. When blocks come too fast or too slow, this parameter adjusts to regulate the block speed. The difficulty thereby measures the approximate hashrate of the network on average.
Target Spacing: The amount of time between blocks on average. The difficulty adjusts to keep the frequency of blocks close to the target. Peercoin has a 10 minute PoS block spacing and a 1 hour PoW block spacing, for a total spacing of 8.57 minutes.
Confirmations: To avoid double spend attacks, it is customary to wait a certain number of blocks after a transaction is included in the chain. Peercoin specifies 6 confirmations before a transaction should be trusted as final.
Blockchain: a recursive chronological record taken through time and secured by a distributed consensus process. New information is added in discrete blocks that include a hash of all the previous blocks to make a tamper-proof record.
Transaction: A cluster of information including inputs, outputs, header information, and OP codes if there are any. Inputs are references to outputs from previous transactions that are being consumed. Outputs have an amount and an address where coins are sent.
Address: A unique string of characters that can be derived from a private key. The address is a hash of the public key, so ownership can be easily verified without giving away the secret. knowing the private key is equivalent to owning the address.
Cryptography: Asymmstric encryption allows for easy validation of public information generated from a secret while figuring out the secret from the generated information is very hard. This is the basis of public/private key pairs and cryptocurrency addresses.
Algorithmic Inflation: Cryptocurrencies like Peercoin introduce new coins provably through the block reward, depending on the transaction validation process, the difficulty, and/or the block height. In this way, the inflation is determined by math rather than a central body.
Signature: a private key is a form of identity and can produce a unique signatuee that can be quickly validated. information, such as a message or a transaction, can also be signed to prove that a party was privy to the information.
Hashrate: the number of valid block hashes produced per unit time by a network, whether or not they achieve the difficulty theshold to produce a block. In Peercoin, the hashrate is limited to once per second per output and the coinage consumed is used to determine block validity.
Blockheight: The number of blocks preceding a specified block. Can also refer to the total number of blocks in a chain. If there are two valid blocks produced at the same block height, one must be orphaned to continue the chain.
Orphan: A valid block that none-the-less is excluded from the chain. A block is orphaned if another block is found at the same blockheight and is chosen for continuation of the chain, instead of the orphaned block.
Transaction Fee: A fee is paid per kilobyte of data to include a transaction in a block. While in many coins the fee is given to the finder of the block, in Peercoin the fee is destroyed which prevents spam and keeps the Peercoin chain compact.
